our story Our journey began in 1999,
                     where we discovered  true reverence for the healing arts. 
this knowledge is passed down   from generation to generation, 
from mother   to daughter, from father to son, and as such is deeply 
entwined in the Balinese way of life. Combining this rich knowledge
 and spirit of   generosity with European techniques,RUTLAND offers
 each guest the ultimate luxuriously   healing experience.
